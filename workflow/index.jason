To make the GIST wipe happen at run 3 instead of run 6, you need to make these changes:

1. **Line 2364** - Change the log message:
```javascript
// FROM:
log(`🔄 Run ${state.run_counter}/6`);
// TO:
log(`🔄 Run ${state.run_counter}/3`);
```

2. **Line 2366** - Change the wipe condition:
```javascript
// FROM:
const SHOULD_WIPE = (state.run_counter >= 6);
// TO:
const SHOULD_WIPE = (state.run_counter >= 3);
```

3. **Line 2369** - Update the wipe log message:
```javascript
// FROM:
log("🗑️  RUN 6: WIPE GIST AND RESTART FRESH");
// TO:
log("🗑️  RUN 3: WIPE GIST AND RESTART FRESH");
```

These three changes will make the GIST wipe and reset happen every 3 runs instead of every 6 runs. The system will now:
- Run 1: Normal operation
- Run 2: Normal operation  
- Run 3: Wipe GIST and restart fresh with run_counter reset to 0
- Then repeat the cycle
